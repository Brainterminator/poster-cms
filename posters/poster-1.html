            <h1>A NEW HOPE</h1>
            <p>It is a period of civil war.
                Rebel spaceships, striking
                from a hidden base, have won
                their first victory against
                the evil Galactic Empire.
                
                During the battle, Rebel
                spies managed to steal secret
                plans to the Empire's
                ultimate weapon, the DEATH
                STAR, an armored space
                station with enough power to
                destroy an entire planet.
                
                Pursued by the Empire's
                sinister agents, Princess
                Leia races home aboard her
                starship, custodian of the
                stolen plans that can save
                her people and restore
                freedom to the galaxy....</p>

            <h1>THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK</h1>
            <p>It is a dark time for the
                Rebellion. Although the Death
                Star has been destroyed,
                Imperial troops have driven the
                Rebel forces from their hidden
                base and pursued them across
                the galaxy.
                
                Evading the dreaded Imperial
                Starfleet, a group of freedom
                fighters led by Luke Skywalker
                has established a new secret
                base on the remote ice world
                of Hoth.
                
                The evil lord Darth Vader,
                obsessed with finding young
                Skywalker, has dispatched
                thousands of remote probes into
                the far reaches of space....</p>

            <h1>RETURN OF THE JEDI</h1>
            <p>Luke Skywalker has returned to
                his home planet of Tatooine in
                an attempt to rescue his
                friend Han Solo from the
                clutches of the vile gangster
                Jabba the Hutt.
                
                Little does Luke know that the
                GALACTIC EMPIRE has secretly
                begun construction on a new
                armored space station even
                more powerful than the first
                dreaded Death Star.
                
                When completed, this ultimate
                weapon will spell certain doom
                for the small band of rebels
                struggling to restore freedom
                to the galaxy...</p>
