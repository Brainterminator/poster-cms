            <p>It is a dark time for the
                Rebellion. Although the Death
                Star has been destroyed,
                Imperial troops have driven the
                Rebel forces from their hidden
                base and pursued them across
                the galaxy.
                
                Evading the dreaded Imperial
                Starfleet, a group of freedom
                fighters led by Luke Skywalker
                has established a new secret
                base on the remote ice world
                of Hoth.
                
                The evil lord Darth Vader,

            <p>Luke Skywalker has returned to
                his home planet of Tatooine in
                an attempt to rescue his
                friend Han Solo from the
                clutches of the vile gangster
                Jabba the Hutt.
                
                Little does Luke know that the
                GALACTIC EMPIRE has secretly
                begun construction on a new
                armored space station even
                more powerful than the first
                dreaded Death Star.

                weapon will spell certain doom
